This project delves into the fascinating intersection of pebble games and the k-WL algorithm, two powerful concepts in graph theory and computer science. These two concepts are brought to life through an interactive and visually engaging interface that allows the user to explore the dynamics of pebble games and the iterative refinement process of the k-WL algorithm in a way that is both accessible and intuitive
